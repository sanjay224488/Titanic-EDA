# Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python. The goal is to extract insights and patterns related to passenger survival using data visualization and statistical exploration.


## Files Included
- **EDA.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook with all code, visualizations, and observations.
- **TASK-5-DA.pdf**: PDF report summarizing key findings.
- **train.csv**: Training dataset with passenger information and survival status.
- **test.csv**: Test dataset for prediction (optional usage).
- **gender_submission.csv**: Sample submission file.


## Tools and Libraries
- Python 3
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook


## Analysis Steps
1. Load and inspect the data.
2. Clean missing values and handle null data.
3. Perform univariate analysis (histograms, boxplots, countplots).
4. Conduct bivariate analysis to explore survival relations.
5. Use multivariate visualization methods (pairplot, heatmap).
6. Create new features like FamilySize.
7. Document detailed observations for each plot.
8. Summarize main insights in a final report.


## Key Findings
- Females were more likely to survive than males.
- Higher passenger classes had better survival chances.
- Age and family size impacted survival probability.
- Certain patterns and trends are visible across different features.
